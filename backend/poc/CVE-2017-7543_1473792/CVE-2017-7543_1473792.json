        "Paul Needle of Red Hat reports:\n\niptables/firewalld is not active on overcloud compute and controller nodes, following an 'openstack overcloud update ...' procedure run in a production environment yesterday. This has major impact given that there are end-customer workloads running in this environment.",
        "Acknowledgements:\n\nName: Paul Needle (Red Hat)",
        "All bugs except OSP12 are in MODIFIED now. OSP12 will get the fix through regular RDO sync process (we can leave it without a OSP fix for the time being because it was not released yet).",
        "Mitigation:\n\nTo determine whether your system is impacted, run:\n$ sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables \n$ sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables\nBoth should be set to 1\n\nTo reset security groups to '1':\n1. Apply the following configuration modification:\n$ sudo sed -i.back -e 's/reapply_sysctl = 0/reapply_sysctl = 1/' /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf\n\n2. Ensure the modification was successful:\n$ grep reapply_sysctl /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf\nshould be \"reapply_sysctl = 1\"\n\n3. Check whether tuned is running:\n$ sudo systemctl status tuned\n\n4. Restart tuned to apply the new configuration:\n$ sudo systemctl restart tuned\n\n5. Recheck your security groups and the status of 'reapply_sysctl'.",
