        "Title: Neutron L2 agent DoS through incorrect allowed address pairs\nReporter: Darragh O'Reilly (HP)\nProducts: Neutron\nAffects: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3 and 2015.1.0 version\n\nDescription:\nDarragh O'Reilly from HP reported a vulnerability in Neutron. By adding\nan address pair which is rejected as invalid by the ipset tool, an\nauthenticated user may crash the Neutron L2 agent resulting in a denial\nof service attack. Neutron setups using the IPTables firewall driver are\naffected.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack upstream for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Darragh O'Reilly (HP) as the original reporter.",

        "Some more notes, the kilo and liberty patch are self healing, if a zero prefixed address pair have already been assigned, then it will be fixed when the service restarts.\n\nJuno patch on the other hand will block attempt to use zero prefixed address pair and if a zero prefixed address pair have already been assigned, then the script included in the patch needs to be run in order to fix it.",
