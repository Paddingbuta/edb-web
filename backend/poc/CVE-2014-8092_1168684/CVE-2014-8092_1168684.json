        "ProcPutImage(), GetHosts(), RegionSizeof(), REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE() calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory\nis needed to handle the client's request have not overflowed, so can\nresult in out of bounds reads or writes.  These calls all occur only\nafter a client has successfully authenticated itself.\n\nIntroduced in X11R1 (1987).",

        "In all the patches above, some calculation is done on data sent by the client and it results in a 32-bit integer overflow. That integer is used to malloc memory and client-controlled data is then copied into it. \n\nIn most of the cases it could result in arbitrary code execution as root, and in Xorg client/server step could result in privilege escalation.",
