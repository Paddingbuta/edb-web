        "The following flaw was reported in Subversion:\n\nSubversion's httpd servers are vulnerable to a remotely triggerable heap-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read caused by an integer overflow when parsing skel-encoded request bodies.\n\nThis allows remote attackers with write access to a repository to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code under the context of the httpd process. 32-bit server versions are vulnerable to both the denial-of-service attack and possible arbitrary code execution. 64-bit server versions are only vulnerable to the denial-of-service attack.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Ivan Zhakov of VisualSVN as the original reporter.",
