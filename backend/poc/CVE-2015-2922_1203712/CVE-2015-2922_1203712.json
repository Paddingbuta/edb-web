        "Linux kernel built with the IPv6 networking support(CONFIG_IPV6) is vulnerable to setting its 'hop_limit' too low, via the neighbour discovery protocol. It could result in thwarting the IPv6 functionality.\n\nAn unprivileged user on a local network could use this flaw to cause DoS to a remote system.\n\nUpstream fix:\n-------------\n  ->https://git.kernel.org/linus/6fd99094de2b83d1d4c8457f2c83483b2828e75aReference:\n----------\n  ->http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/04/2",

        "In the attachment there is a patch for the Linux kernel that fixes this issue.\n\nOther suggested mitigations:\n* Disallowing Router Advertisements on a Switch level (RA filtering)\n* Dropping Router Advertisements that do not contain a network/route\n* Dropping Router Advertisements with short hop limits (hop limit < 40 or similar)\n\nOther interesting combinations is to send \"route removal\" packet (timeout = 0 )  in combination.\nReported found that it isn't necessary, but most code paths will then delete the route if it finds it, even if it's not getting the \"drop route\" message from the host that advertised the route.",
