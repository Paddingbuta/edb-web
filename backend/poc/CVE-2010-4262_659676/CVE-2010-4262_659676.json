        "A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in\nthe way Xfig processed certain FIG images. A remote\nattacker could create a FIG image with specially-crafted\ncolor definition, and trick the local, unsuspecting\nuser into opening it, which could lead to xfig executable\ncrash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with\nthe privileges of the user running the executable.\n\nReferences:\n[1]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=657981Public PoC:\n[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=463393Flaw severity note:\nOn systems with compile time buffer checks (FORTIFY_SOURCE)\nfeature enabled, the impact of this flaw is mitigated to\nbe only crash.",
