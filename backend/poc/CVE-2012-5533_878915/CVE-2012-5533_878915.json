The maintener semms to be offline for a long time now.\n\nIt's build against CentOS 6.4 and epel and works well on our RHEL 6 servers.\n\nNot tested on Fedora and RHEL 5.\n\nMay be somebody will take over the rpm - I'm not a maintener.\n\nI just changed the release to 1.4.32 and adjusted the mod_geoip  patch.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nThanks and BR",
