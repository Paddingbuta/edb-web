Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best
        state is but a necessary evil
in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are
        exposed to the same miseries by a
government, which we might expect in a country without government, our
        calamities is heightened by
reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer! Government,
        like dress, is the badge of
lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the
        bowers of paradise. For were
the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man
        would need no other
lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to
        surrender up a part of his property
to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced
        to do by the same prudence which
in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.
        Wherefore, security being the true
design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form
        thereof appears most likely to
ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is
        preferable to all others.
