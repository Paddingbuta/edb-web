QA for FC1 version -- mysql packages:

264c90e5f71b15bd1c416587a36a209a020a4cff__mysql-3.23.58-4.6.legacy.i386.rpm
0b39c15da8705ea47fed4dbfcac4eaac22b0b909__mysql-bench-3.23.58-4.6.legacy.i386.rpm

  * SHA1SUMS match announcement; signatures verify
  * packages install fine (tho' didn't install mysql-bench)
  * Everything seems to work well with very light testing; EXCEPT:
  * It looks like there is another typo in the /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld script.

When mysqld is shutdown using this script, and the shutdown succeeds, 
the script attempts to delete '/var/log/subsys/mysqld', instead of 
deleting '/var/lock/subsys/mysqld'.  This makes the service subsystem
think that mysqld is still active somehow; so you get something like this:

    # service mysqld start
    Starting MySQL:                                            [  OK  ]
    # service mysqld stop
    Stopping MySQL:                                            [  OK  ]
    # service mysqld status
    mysqld dead but subsys locked
    # shutdown now

    Broadcast message from root (tty1) (Mon Jan  2 04:55:18 2006):

    The system is going down to maintenance mode NOW!
    INIT: Switching to runlevel: 1
    INIT: Sending processes the TERM signal
    Stopping system message bus:                               [  OK  ]
    Stopping atd:                                              [  OK  ]
    Shutting down xfs:                                         [  OK  ]
    Stopping MySQL:                                            [FAILED]
    ...

This typo affects the /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld file for all 4 distros.
A suggested patch is attached (at least for the FC1 version of this
file).

Other than this minor typo, everything looks fine.  I think this typo
can be fixed in the build system and we can still push these to updates.
So I can give this a VERIFY vote provided that this is fixed.
