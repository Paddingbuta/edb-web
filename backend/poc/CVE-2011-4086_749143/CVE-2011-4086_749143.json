        "journal_unmap_buffer()'s zap_buffer: code clears a lot of buffer head\nstate ala discard_buffer(), but does not touch _Delay or _Unwritten\nas discard_buffer() does.\n\nThis can be problematic in some areas of the ext4 code which assume\nthat if they have found a buffer marked unwritten or delay, then it's\na live one.  They do not check whether a buffer is mapped, so\njbd2's partial teardown can be problematic if they assume that\nthis buffer head is still valid.\n\n(Mounting without a journal also avoids the bug, because\nwith no journal we go to unmap_buffer(), which does the right\nthing).\n\nAn unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.",
