        "ush.it reported multiple flaws affecting jetty 6.x and 7.x:http://www.ush.it/2009/10/25/jetty-6x-and-7x-multiple-vulnerabilities/Issues reported include:\n\n E) \"Cookie Dump Servlet\" escape sequence injection\n    (Affected versions: Any)\n\n F) Http Content-Length header escape sequence injection\n    (Affected versions: Any)\n\nAn attacker-supplied input containing special characters may be copied to stack traces printed to jetty log when exception is raised due to some problem with parsing user input (non-numeric Max-Age value in case of demo Cookie servlet (E) or non-numeric Content-Length HTTP header value (F)).  When log file is later viewed in a terminal that understands special escape sequences (most graphical terminal emulators), those escape sequences may cause terminal to run an arbitrary command.\n\nUpstream bug:http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-1129(no useful info)\n\nUpstream commits referencing JETTY-1129:http://fisheye.codehaus.org/changelog/jetty/?cs=5628http://fisheye.codehaus.org/changelog/jetty/?cs=5631",
