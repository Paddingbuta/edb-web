        "Mysql log file obfuscationhttp://secunia.com/advisories/19034The following text is from tgl:\n\nYeah, problem confirmed locally: the query log message is truncated,\n\n060227 11:15:47       6 Connect     root@localhost on test\n6 Query       /* x */ select 2+2\n6 Quit\n060227 11:16:24       7 Connect     root@localhost on test\n7 Query       /*\n7 Quit\n\nThe report is perhaps deliberately obscure: you can *not* exploit this\nthrough mysql_query() because it expects a null-terminated string\nanyway.  But you can exploit it through mysql_real_query() which takes\na pointer and count.\n\nI'd class the severity as pretty low, since all it allows is hiding\nsome traces of an attack after the attacker has already broken into\nthe database.  But since MySQL make a point of how mysql_real_query()\nsupports embedded nulls in the query string, it's certainly a bug.\n\n\nThis issue also affects RHEL3\nThis issue also affects RHEL2.1",
