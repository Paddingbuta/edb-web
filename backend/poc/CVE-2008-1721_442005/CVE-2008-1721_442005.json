        "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifierCVE-2008-1721to the following vulnerability:\n\nInteger signedness error in the zlib extension module in Python 2.5.2\nand earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a\nnegative signed integer, which triggers insufficient memory allocation\nand a buffer overflow.\n\nReferences:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/490690/100/0/threadedhttp://bugs.python.org/issue2586http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/28715",
        "Since this issue requires a rather silly use of the python zlib module, we have\nclassified it as having a low security impact.\n\nA future update may address this flaw. More information regarding issue severity\ncan be found here:http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/",
