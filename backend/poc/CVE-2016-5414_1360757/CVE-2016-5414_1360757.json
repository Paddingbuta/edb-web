    "comment": [
        "It was found that FreeIPA fails to check the CA ACLs properly, moreover the SAN name is incorrectly checked for service principals which means someone can request an arbitrary SAN name for services.\n\nThe vulnerable code was added in the 4.4.0 release, which is not yet available in Fedora or RHEL.",
