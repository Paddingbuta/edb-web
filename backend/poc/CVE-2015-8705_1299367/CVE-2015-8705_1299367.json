        "The following flaw in BIND was reported by ISC:\n\nIn versions of BIND 9.10, errors can occur when OPT pseudo-RR data or ECS options are formatted to text. In 9.10.3 through 9.10.3-P2, the issue may result in a REQUIRE assertion failure in buffer.c. In prior 9.10 versions, it may result in named crashing (such as with a segmentation fault) or other misbehavior due to a buffer overrun.\n\nThis issue can affect both authoritative and recursive servers if they are performing debug logging. (It may also crash related tools which use the same code, such as dig or delv.)\n\nMitigation:\n\nDisable debug logging in named.",
        "Acknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting this issue.",
