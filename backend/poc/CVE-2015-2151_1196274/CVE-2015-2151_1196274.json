        "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nInstructions with register operands ignore eventual segment overrides\nencoded for them. Due to an insufficiently conditional assignment such\na bogus segment override can, however, corrupt a pointer used\nsubsequently to store the result of the instruction.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious guest might be able to read sensitive data relating to\nother guests, or to cause denial of service on the host. Arbitrary code\nexecution, and therefore privilege escalation, cannot be excluded.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen 3.2.x and later are vulnerable.\nXen 3.1.x and earlier have not been inspected.\n\nOnly x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThere is no mitigation available for this issue.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.\n\nxsa123.patch xen-unstable, Xen 4.5.x, Xen 4.4.x\nxsa123-4.3-4.2.patch Xen 4.3.x, Xen 4.2.x\n\n$ sha256sum xsa123*.patch\nc65ff7e169416b8c8aef93f2f1b4c259f123f244cdb3ab7a1f4fe714000752ff xsa123-4.3-4.2.patch\n6f1587f9e0a4b9325c75c004b0069b5d5303a725cf7dd8def18c01b9d0aa8912 xsa123.patch",
