        "It was reported that when an application has Groovy on the classpath and that it uses standard Java serialization mechanim to communicate between servers, or to store local data, it is possible for an attacker to bake a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability.\n\nMitigation:\n\nApply the following patch on the MethodClosure class (src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/MethodClosure.java):\n\n    public class MethodClosure extends Closure {\n        +    private Object readResolve() {\n        +        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n        +    \n        }\n\nAlternatively, you should make sure to use a custom security policy file (using the standard Java security manager) or make sure that you do not rely on serialization to communicate remotely.\n\nExternal References:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/121",
        "A mitigation for this issue is not to call a MethodClosure which has been deserialized. Alternatively ensure that data which can be intercepted is encrypted. For example using SSL when sending serialized MethodClosures over a network connection.",
