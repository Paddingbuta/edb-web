        "Mozilla has released a new version of Mozilla Thunderbird that corrects\nserious and critical vulnerabilities in that product.  Red Hat has issued\nadvisory RHSA-2006:0330-01 <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0330.html>.\nWith that advisory, Red Hat has released thunderbird-1.0.8-1.4.1.\n\nHere is the Problem Description from that advisory:\n\n\"Several bugs were found in the way Thunderbird processes malformed\njavascript. A malicious HTML mail message could modify the content of a\ndifferent open HTML mail message, possibly stealing sensitive information\nor conducting a cross-site scripting attack. Please note that JavaScript\nsupport is disabled by default in Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-1731,CVE-2006-1732,CVE-2006-1741)\n\n\"Several bugs were found in the way Thunderbird processes certain \njavascript actions. A malicious HTML mail message could execute arbitrary \njavascript instructions with the permissions of 'chrome', allowing the \npage to steal sensitive information or install browser malware. Please \nnote that JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. \n(CVE-2006-0292,CVE-2006-0296,CVE-2006-1727,CVE-2006-1728,CVE-2006-1733,CVE-2006-1734,CVE-2006-1735,CVE-2006-1742)\n\n\"Several bugs were found in the way Thunderbird processes malformed HTML\nmail messages.  A carefully crafted malicious HTML mail message could \ncause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.\n(CVE-2006-0749,CVE-2006-1724,CVE-2006-1730,CVE-2006-1737,CVE-2006-1738,CVE-2006-1739,CVE-2006-1790)\n\n\"A bug was found in the way Thunderbird processes certain inline content \nin HTML mail messages. It may be possible for a remote attacker to send a\ncarefully crafted mail message to the victim, which will fetch remote\ncontent, even if Thunderbird is configured not to fetch remote content.\n(CVE-2006-1045)\n\n\"Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this updated package\ncontaining Thunderbird version 1.0.8, which is not vulnerable to these \nissues.\"",
