        "By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability during the stack creation. It may result in potential assets theft like user access credentials. Only setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.\n\nAcknowledgement:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue.
