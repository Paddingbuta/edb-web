        "Following issue was reported in Django:\n\nPreviously, a session could be created when anonymously accessing the\n``django.contrib.auth.views.logout`` view (provided it wasn't decorated\nwith ``django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required`` as done in the\nadmin). This could allow an attacker to easily create many new session\nrecords by sending repeated requests, potentially filling up the session\nstore or causing other users' session records to be evicted.",
