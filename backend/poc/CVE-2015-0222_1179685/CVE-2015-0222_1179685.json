        "The Django project reports the following issue:\n\n\"\"\"\nGiven a form that uses ``ModelMultipleChoiceField`` and ``show_hidden_initial=True`` (not a documented API), it was possible for a user to cause an unreasonable number of SQL queries by submitting duplicate values for the field's data. The validation logic in ``ModelMultipleChoiceField`` now deduplicates submitted values to address this issue.\n\"\"\"\n\nThis issue is resolved in the upstream versions 1.7.3 and 1.6.10.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this issue.",
