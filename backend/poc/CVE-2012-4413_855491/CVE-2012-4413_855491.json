        "Russell Bryant (rbryant) of the OpenStack Project reports:\n\nTitle: Revoking a role does not affect existing tokens\nImpact: High\nReporter: Dolph Mathews (Rackspace)\nProducts: Keystone\nAffects: Essex, Folsom\n\nDescription:\nDolph Mathews reported a vulnerability in Keystone. Granting and\nrevoking roles from a user is not reflected upon token validation for\npre-existing tokens. Pre-existing tokens continue to be valid for the\noriginal set of roles for the remainder of the token's lifespan, or\nuntil explicitly invalidated. This fix invalidates all tokens held by\na user upon role grant/revoke to circumvent the issue.",
        "See the attached patches. For Essex, the following patch also needs to\nbe in place before the fix for the vulnerability will be fully\neffective:https://review.openstack.org/#/c/12590/. The equivalent\npatch for the memcached token backend in Folsom has already been merged.",
