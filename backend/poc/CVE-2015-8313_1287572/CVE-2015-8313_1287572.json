        "It was discovered that gnutls incorrectly validates the first byte of padding in CBC modes. A remote attacker can possibly take advantage of this flaw to perform a padding oracle attack. Affected are older versions of gnutls (2.x).\n\nPublic via:https://www.debian.org/security/2015/dsa-3408http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2015/Dec/0",
