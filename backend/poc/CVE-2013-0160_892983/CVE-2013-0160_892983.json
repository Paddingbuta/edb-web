        "A security flaw was found in the way \"/dev/ptmx\", a character device used to create a pseudo-terminal master (PTM) and slave (PTS) pair, of the Linux kernel, used to transmit data through the PTM when a keystroke was pressed. An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to determine inter-keystroke timing (measure latency between keystrokes), possibly allowing them to determine effective length of an password being typed in.\n\nReferences:\n[1]http://vladz.devzero.fr/013_ptmx-timing.php[2]http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~dawnsong/papers/ssh-timing.pdf[3]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/07/5[4]https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=797175Reproducers:\n[5]http://vladz.devzero.fr/svn/codes/PoC/ptmx-keystroke-latency.c(to display latency between keystrokes)\n[6]http://vladz.devzero.fr/svn/codes/PoC/ptmx-su-pwdlen.sh(to determine password length)\n\n\nThis issue was found by researcher with nickname vladz.",
