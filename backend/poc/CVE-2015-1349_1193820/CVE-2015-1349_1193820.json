        "It was reported that a problem with trust anchor management can cause named to crash, affecting BIND versions 9.7.0+.\n\nISC developers believe that it will be very difficult for this to be triggered in most cases, requiring DNSSEC validation amongst other factors.\n\nISC will not be producing patches specifically for BIND 9.8 or BIND 9.6-ESV, both of which are beyond their End of Life (EOL) and are no longer supported by ISC.\n\nPatches that correct this issue for ISC BIND 9.10.1 and ISC BIND 9.9.6 are attached to this Bugzilla.",
