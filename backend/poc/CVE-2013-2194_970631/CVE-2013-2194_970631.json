        "The ELF parser used by the Xen tools to read domains' kernels and\nconstruct domains has multiple integer overflows, pointer dereferences\nbased on calculations from unchecked input values, and other problems.\n\nA malicious PV domain administrator who can specify their own kernel\ncan escalate their privilege to that of the domain construction tools\n(i.e., normally, to control of the host).\n\nReferences:http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-06/msg00223.htmlAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.",
