        "William Robinet reports:\n\n\"\"\"\nInfo-ZIP \"UnZip\" is an extraction utility for archives compressed in \".zip\"\nformat.\n\nOut-of-bounds write can be triggered with a malformed zip file resulting in a\ncrash or arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe problem lies in the \"unix/unix.c:charset_to_intern()\" function which is\npart of the 06-unzip60-alt-iconv-utf8 patch (Ubuntu reference [0]).\n\nIt can be triggered during string conversion from CP866 to UTF-8 for which the\ndestination buffer is not large enough.\n\n[0] Ubuntu iconv patch:http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/u/unzip/unzip_6.0-9ubuntu1.2.debian.tar.gzfile debian/patches/06-unzip60-alt-iconv-utf8\n\"\"\"\n\nAcknowledgment:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank William Robinet for reporting this issue.",
        "Createdattachment 991545[details]Vulnerable function\n\nPart of the 06-unzip60-alt-iconv-utf8 patch which contains the vulnerable function.",
        "This issue does not affect any released upstream version.  Affected code does not exist in the latest upstream version - 6.0.  It is introduced as part of a patch that adds support for file names using non-latin and non-unicode encoding, which is used in unzip packages in certain Linux or BSD distributions.  The patch has been proposed for inclusion in Red Hat Enterprise Linux unzip packages - seebug 885540 comment 2- but has not been applied there or in Fedora to date.  Therefore, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora unzip packages are not affected by this issue.\n\nIt should be noted that the code seems to have been accepted upstream, as it appears in the 6.1 development/beta code.\n\nStatement:\n\nNot vulnerable. This issue did not affect the version of unzip as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.",
