        "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nOn ARM systems the code which deals with virtualising the GIC\ndistributor would, under various circumstances, log messages on a\nguest accessible code path without appropriate rate limiting.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious guest could cause repeated logging to the hypervisor\nconsole, leading to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen 4.4 and later systems running on ARM hardware are vulnerable.\n\nx86 systems are not affected.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThe problematic log messages are issued with priority Warning.\n\nTherefore they can be rate limited by adding \"loglvl=error/warning\" to the\nhypervisor command line or suppressed entirely by adding \"loglvl=error\".\n\nApplying the attached patch(es) resolves this issue.\n\nStatement:\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of xen as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Xen for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Julien Grall as the original reporter.",
