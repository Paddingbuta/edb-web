        "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nXSA-77 put the majority of the domctl operations on a list excepting\nthem from having security advisories issued for them if any effects\ntheir use might have could hamper security. Subsequently some of them\ngot declared disaggregation safe, but for a small subset this was not\nreally correct: Their (mis-)use may result in host lockups.\n\nAs a result, the potential security benefits of toolstack\ndisaggregation are not always fully realised.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nDomains deliberately given partial management control may be able to\ndeny service to the entire host.\n\nAs a result, in a system designed to enhance security by radically\ndisaggregating the management, the security may be reduced. But, the\nsecurity will be no worse than a non-disaggregated design.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 4.3 onwards are vulnerable.\nXen versions 4.2 and earlier do not have the described disaggregation\nfunctionality and hence are not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThe issues discussed in this advisory are themselves bugs in features\nused for a security risk mitigation.\n\nThere is no further mitigation available, beyond general measures to\ntry to avoid parts of the system management becoming controlled by\nattackers. Those are the kind of measures which we expect any users\nof radical disaggregation to have already deployed.\n\nSwitching from disaggregated to a non-disaggregated operation does NOT\nmitigate these vulnerabilities. Rather, it simply recategorises the\nvulnerability to hostile management code, regarding it \"as designed\";\nthus it merely reclassifies these issues as \"not a bug\".\n\nUsers and vendors of disaggregated systems should not change their\nconfiguration. The robustness benefits of disaggregation are\nunaffected, and (depending on system design) security benefits are\nlikely to remain despite the vulnerabilities.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.",
