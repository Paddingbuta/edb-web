        "It was found that a flaw in commons-collection library allowed remote code execution wherever deserialization occurs. While JBoss doesnt expose the JMXInvokerServlet by default, other interfaces where deserialization occur might be vulnerable.\n\nNote: classes directly referenced by this flaw:\nInvokerTransformer, InstantiateFactory, and InstantiateTransformer\n\nExternal References:http://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2045023",
        "This was addressed back in 2012:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0874While we have the JMXInvokerHAServlet secured now in EAP 5, we're treating this bug as the ability for commons-collections to execute code during deserialization.",

Deserialization of those classes can be re-enabled using the newly introduced system property \"org.apache.commons.collections.enableUnsafeSerialization\".\n\nThe following patches were applied upstream in the 3.2.x branch:http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1713307http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1713537http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1713845These changes were applied in upstream Apache Commons Collections version 3.2.2 and should also be included in version 4.1:https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/release_3_2_2.html",
