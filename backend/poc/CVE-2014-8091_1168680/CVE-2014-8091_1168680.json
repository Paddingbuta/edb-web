        "In servers built with support for SUN-DES-1 (Secure RPC)\nauthentication credentials, an unauthenticated client may be able to\ncrash the X server by sending a connection request specifying values\nthat cause malloc to fail, causing the authentication routines to\nattempt to write data to the returned NULL pointer.  Since the request\nis limited to an unsigned 16-bit integer for the allocation size, it is \nunlikely to fail unless the server is severely memory constrained.\n\nIntroduced in the initial revision of Secure RPC support in X11R5 (1991)",

        "This issue arises because Xorg server fails to check the return value from a malloc call. The size of data(len) to be malloced is set by the authenticated client. \n\nlen is unsigned 16 bits (as per the X protocol, sent by the client), though the server casts it into a int.\n\nSo, successful exploitation will require malloc to fail when allocating a buffer of size UINT16_MAX",
