        "It was foudn that FUSE, a Filesystem in USErspace, did not properly sanitize environment variables before executing a mount or umount operation with elevated privileges. A local attacker could use this flaw to overwrite arbitrary files on the system or escalate their privileges.\n\nAdditional details:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/520Patch proposed on distros is attached.",

        "Upstream commit:http://sourceforge.net/p/fuse/fuse/ci/fe2d96/On affected systems, this issue would allow local users to escalate their privileges to root, and hence would be rated as Important impact issue.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux is not affected by the published attack.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, /etc/mtab is not a regular file but a symlink to /proc/self/mtab.  That prevents fusermount from running mount and umount (see mtab_needs_update() function).  Even though mount and umount in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 use libmount that supports reading LIBMOUNT_MTAB environment variable, they are not run by fusermount.  Similar applies to current Fedora versions.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, /etc/mtab is regular file and hence fusermount runs mount and umount commands.  However, mount and umount in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier do not use libmount (on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, libmount is part of the util-linux-ng packages, but not used by mount and umount commands; on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the util-linux packages do not contain libmount library).\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Hypervisor contains the libguestfs-winsupport packages, which includes ntfs-3g.  However, ntfs-3g is not installed as setuid root and hence there is no privilege escalation risk.",
