        "The upstream bug mentions a separate issue that may cause out-of-bounds writes. While this looks correct initially, I don't think that this is feasible:\nThe memory is allocated using _cairo_malloc_ab(), which has a built-in overflow check. As far as I can tell, this will catch the problem before we can reach the problematic code.\n\nThis leaves only the out-of-bounds read, which, all things considered, isn't really that dangerous.",
