        "Description of problem:\n\nOpenSceneGraph source rpm, as shipped with Fedora-12 contains\nembedded copy of lib3ds library (its relevant code parts\nvulnerable toCVE-2010-0280flaw).\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\nOpenSceneGraph-2.8.2-5.fc12.src.rpm\n\nAdditional info:\nThe relevant code part is located in:\n\nBUILD/OpenSceneGraph-2.8.2/OpenSceneGraph-2.8.2/src/osgPlugins/3ds/mesh.cpp\n\nSee also:\n[1]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-0280and patch from:\n[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=633475#c4for further information, how to address this problem.\n\nAlso: Please consider the OpenSceneGraph package in Fedora-12\n      to use system lib3ds library, which is not vulnerable to this\n      flaw already. This is the preferred way of fixing the deficiency,\n      as could be helpful also in future cases like this one.",
        "This message is a reminder that Fedora 12 is nearing its end of life.\nApproximately 30 (thirty) days from now Fedora will stop maintaining\nand issuing updates for Fedora 12.  It is Fedora's policy to close all\nbug reports from releases that are no longer maintained.  At that time\nthis bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora \n'version' of '12'.\n\nPackage Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you\nplan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' \nto a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 12's end of life.\n\nBug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that \nwe may not be able to fix it before Fedora 12 is end of life.  If you \nwould still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it \nagainst a later version of Fedora please change the 'version' of this \nbug to the applicable version.  If you are unable to change the version, \nplease add a comment here and someone will do it for you.\n\nAlthough we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's \nlifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a \nmore recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes \nbugs or makes them obsolete.\n\nThe process we are following is described here:http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping",
        "I've applied a patch to fix this issue to f12's git, unfortunately this package fails to build for f12/ppc, seemingly due to issues unrelated to OpenSceneGraph:\n\nc.f.http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=2573653http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=2573659http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/getfile?taskID=2573659&name=build.logBuilding for f13, whose source code is identical to the f12 version, succeeds (No surprise, because the ppc has been removed).\n\nProvided f12 is near to its ETA, I am inclined to leave this bug\nunaddressed for f12.",

        "Fedora 12 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2010-12-02. Fedora 12 is \nno longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further \nsecurity or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.\n\nIf you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of \nFedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version.\n\nThank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed."
