        "Alexander E. Patrakov recently reported a vulnerability in strongSwan\nthat may enable rogue servers to gain user credentials from a client in\ncertain IKEv2 setups [1]. Affected are all strongSwan versions since\n4.3.0 including the latest 5.3.1.CVE-2015-4171has been assigned for this vulnerability.\n\nThe problem occurs in IKEv2 connections where the server is\nauthenticated with a certificate and the client authenticates itself\nwith EAP or pre-shared keys. Any constraints the client has for the\nserver's authentication (e.g. rightid or rightca) are only enforced\nafter all authentication rounds are completed successfully. A rogue\nserver that is able to authenticate itself with a valid certificate\nissued by any CA the client trusts, is, therefore, able to trick the\nclient into continuing its authentication. In case of EAP this causes\nthe client to reveal its username and password digest, and if it accepts\nEAP-GTC it is even possible to force it into sending a plaintext\npassword. Please refer to the email by Alexander for a practical example:\n\n[1]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/29/6The attached patches fix the vulnerability in the respective strongSwan\nversions and should apply with appropriate hunk offsets.\n\nStatement:\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of strongimcv as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they did not include support for IKEv2.",
