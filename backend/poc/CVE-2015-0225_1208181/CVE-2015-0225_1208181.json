        "It was found that Apache Cassandra bound an unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface to all network interfaces. A remote attacker able to access the RMI, an API for the transport and remote execution of serialized Java, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the user running Cassandra.\n\nThis issue is fixed in versions 2.0.14 and 2.1.4 of Cassandra. The 1.2.x version of Cassandra no longer receives updates.\n\nThis issue can be mitigated by manually configuring encryption and authentication for JMX as documented athttps://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/JmxSecurity.\n\nUpstream announcement:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/5",
