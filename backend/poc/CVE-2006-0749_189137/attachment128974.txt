---------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

An updated firefox package that fixes several security bugs is now
available.

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards
compliance, performance and portability.

Several bugs were found in the way Firefox processes malformed javascript.
A malicious web page could modify the content of a different open web page,
possibly stealing sensitive information or conducting a cross-site
scripting attack. (CVE-2006-1731, CVE-2006-1732, CVE-2006-1741)

Several bugs were found in the way Firefox processes certain javascript
actions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript
instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-1727,
CVE-2006-1728, CVE-2006-1733, CVE-2006-1734, CVE-2006-1735, CVE-2006-1742)

Several bugs were found in the way Firefox processes malformed web pages.
A carefully crafted malicious web page could cause the execution of
arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-0748, CVE-2006-0749,
CVE-2006-1724, CVE-2006-1730, CVE-2006-1737, CVE-2006-1738, CVE-2006-1739,
CVE-2006-1790)

A bug was found in the way Firefox displays the secure site icon. If a
browser is configured to display the non-default secure site modal warning
dialog, it may be possible to trick a user into believing they are viewing
a secure site. (CVE-2006-1740)

A bug was found in the way Firefox allows javascript mutation events on
"input" form elements. A malicious web page could be created in such a way
that when a user submits a form, an arbitrary file could be uploaded to the
attacker. (CVE-2006-1729)

Users of Firefox are advised to upgrade to these updated packages
containing Firefox version 1.0.8 which corrects these issues.
