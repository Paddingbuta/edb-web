        "Sendmail race condition issue\n\nCERT has reported a race condition issue in sendmail which may lead to\narbitrary remote code execution.\n\nCERT has assinged this issue the name VU#834865\n\nthis is the FL version ofbug 184465",
        "From CERT VU#834865[1]:\n\nThe Problem\n\nSendmail contains a race condition caused by the improper handling of\nasynchronous signals. In particular, by forcing SMTP server to have an I/O\ntimeout at exactly the correct instant, the attacker may be able to execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the Sendmail process.\n\nMore information is available in the Sendmail version 8.13.6 release page[2]\nand the Sendmail MTA Security Vulnerability Advisory[3].\n\nVersions of Sendmail prior to 8.13.6 are affected.\n\nII. Impact\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the Sendmail process. If Sendmail is running as root, the\nattacker could take complete control of an affected system.\n\nIII. Solution\nUpgrade\n\nThis issue is corrected in Sendmail version 8.13.6[2].\n\nPatches to correct this issue in Sendmail versions 8.12.11[4] and 8.13.5[5]\nare also available.\n\nRefer to the Sendmail MTA Security Vulnerability Advisory[6] for steps to\nreduce the impact of this vulnerability.\n\nReferences:\n 1.

Affected packages for each distro:\n  * RHL 7.3:  sendmail-8.11.6-27.73\n  * RHL 9:    sendmail-8.12.8-9.90\n  * FC1:      sendmail-8.12.10-1.1.1\n  * FC2:      sendmail-8.12.11-4.6\n  * FC3:      sendmail-8.13.1-2\n\nIn order to fix RHL7.3, RHL9 and FC1, we will need to upgrade those versions\nto sendmail-8.12.11 in order to apply the patch available from upstream.  Or\nwe might just want to re-spin the RHEL 2.1 package, at least for RHL 7.3.\nPerhaps we can respin the RHEL 3 package for RHL9, FC1, & FC2.\n\nMy suggestion for FC3 is that we just implement sendmail-8.13.6 instead of\nupgrading to sendmail-8.13.5 and patching.\n\n\nHere's the text from RHSA-2006-0265 advisory (for RHEL 2.1):\n\n\"A flaw in the handling of asynchronous signals was discovered in Sendmail.\nA remote attacker may be able to exploit a race condition to execute\narbitrary code as root. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nassigned the nameCVE-2006-0058to this issue.\n\n\"By default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, Sendmail is configured to only\naccept connections from the local host. Therefore only users who have\nconfigured Sendmail to listen to remote hosts would be able to be remotely\nexploited by this vulnerability.\n\n\"In order to correct this issue for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users, it\nwas necessary to upgrade the version of Sendmail from 8.11 as originally\nshipped to Sendmail 8.12 with the addition of the security patch supplied\nby Sendmail Inc. This erratum provides updated packages based on Sendmail\n8.12 with a compatibility mode enabled. After updating to these packages,\nusers should pay close attention to their sendmail logs to ensure that the\nupgrade completed sucessfully.\"",

        "Hmm.. I didn't quite understand the reason why you reverted to the old\nalternatives stuff: you seem to be partially simulating the case where\nalternatives is \"no\", even though it was already enabled in RHL73 so many years ago?\n\nIf old_setup is set to \"no\", the packages still depend on the contents of\n/etc/aliases on the build machine (when it runs $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/bin/makemap)\non RHL9.  That's not cool.  (There's a lot of other nastiness in RHL73/RHL9 wrt\nold_setup -- old_setup=no is not correct on RHL73 while old_setup=yes is not\ncorrect on RHL9..)\n\nPerhaps on RHL73, removal of the readlink could be replaced with:\n ls -l /etc/alternatives/mta | sed s\":.* /:/:\" | sed s\":.* -> ::\"\n\n .. where the first sed strips out everything except the filename and path,\nand the second sed reads the symlink if it exists.\n\n+       daemon /usr/sbin/sendmail $([ \"x$DAEMON\" = xyes ] && echo -bd) \\\n+           $([ -n \"$QUEUE\" ] && echo -q$QUEUE)\n\ndoesn't pass at the end $SENDMAIL_OPTARG, so if you do reload(), do you\nlose arguments if you defined any?\n\nOn RHL9, the defined CERT dirs don't exist under /etc/mail/. \n/usr/share/ssl/certs do though, but weren't enabled.  I guess it's bad practice\nto point to cert dirs that don't exist, maybe dnl these from .mc?\n\nRHL9 supports sasl2, but it wasn't enabled in the previous RHL9 sendmail update\nin 2003; it's not clear to me as I don't use SASL whether we should keep the old\npractice or upgrade sendmail to use sasl2.\n\nIn RHL9, smmsp is no longer confTRUSTED_USER.  Apparently RH removed this in Sep\n2003, so I guess it's OK.",
        "The reason everyone is having problems is because the sendmail update we\nreleased contains three more files that were assigned to alternatives. When the\npackage gets upgraded, sendmail is already configured in the systems\nalternatives system, so the three new symlinks don't get created. There are\nthree possible ways around this problem, 1- remove sendmail from alternatives\nduring the upgrade before adding it back in to force alternatives to re-create\nthe symlinks, 2- try and get alternatives to recreate the symlinks with a funky\npostun trigger, 3- revert the three files to their previous behaviour with the\nprevious sendmail release. After much thought, it appeared the simplest way was\nto revert to the way the previous sendmail package worked.\n\nStarting with FC2, sendmail doesn't provide the /etc/aliases anymore. The\nold_setup flag indicates in the spec file if we want an aliases file or not. It\nshould be turned on for rh73, rh9 and fc1. I'm not sure why you say it's turned\noff in rh73, or why you say it shouldn't be turned on in rh9. Please explain.\n\nThe readlink section of the spec file was to upgrade sendmail in RHEL21. This is\nunnecessary with our rh73 upgrade.\n\nThe initscript doesn't pass the $SENDMAIL_OPTARG in the reload function as it\ndoesn't actually start sendmail, it just sends it a -HUP. No need to pass\narguments there.\n\nThe defined CERT dirs under /etc/mail don't exist on any release.
