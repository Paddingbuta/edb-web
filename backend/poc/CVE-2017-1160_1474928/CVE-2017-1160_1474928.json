        "xfrm_migrate() function in net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c file in the Linux kernel build with CONFIG_XFRM_MIGRATE does not check that the dir parameter is less than XFRM_POLICY_MAX. This allows a local attacker cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access) or possibly have unspecified other impact by sending a XFRM_MSG_MIGRATE netlink message. This flaw is present in the Linux kernel since an introduction of XFRM_MSG_MIGRATE in 2.6.21-rc1 and upto 4.13-rc3.\n\nReferences:http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2017/Jul/30http://marc.info/?t=150169629800003&r=1&w=2http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=150169627919528&w=2Suggested upstream patch:https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/klassert/ipsec.git/commit/?id=7bab09631c2a303f87a7eb7e3d69e888673b9b7eAn upstream patch:https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7bab09631c2a303f87a7eb7e3d69e888673b9b7e",
