        "A loop counter error, leading to heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the URL decoder of cURL, an utility for retrieval of files from remote servers, used to decode certain strings. Remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted string that when processed by the URL decoder of cURL would lead to curl executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the curl binary.\n\nAdvisory:http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20130622.htmlPatch:http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-unescape.patch",
