        "The following flaw in BIND was reported by ISC:\n\nA buffer size check used to guard against overflow could cause named to exit with an INSIST failure In apl_42.c.\n\nA server could exit due to an INSIST failure in apl_42.c when performing certain string formatting operations. Examples include (but may not be limited to):\n\nSlaves using text-format db files could be vulnerable if receiving a malformed record in a zone transfer from their master.\n\nMasters using text-format db files could be vulnerable if they accept a malformed record in a DDNS update message.\n\nRecursive resolvers are potentially vulnerable when debug logging, if they are fed a deliberately malformed record by a malicious server.\n\nA server which has cached a specially constructed record could encounter this condition while performing 'rndc dumpdb'.",
        "Acknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting this issue.",
