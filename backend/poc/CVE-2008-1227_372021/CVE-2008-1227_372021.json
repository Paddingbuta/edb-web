        "Description of problem:\npidgin crashes on login to a silc account. I tried setting it up fresh, and from\nold setup. Both caused the crash.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\npidgin-2.2.2-1.fc8.x86_64\n\nHow reproducible:\nEverytime\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install pidgin\n2. Run pidgin\n3. Setup silc account\n  \nActual results:\nCrash\n\nExpected results:\nRuns normally\n\nAdditional info:\nIf run from a terminal window it mentions a buffer overflow.",
        "I can confirm this odd behavior that happens just with silc accounts.\nA workaround for this problem is to downgrade to libsilc-1.0.2-2.fc6, the one\ninstalled by default under fedora 7. \nThis suggest to me that the problem could be in libsilc itself but I didn't\ninvestigate deeper.",
        "I think we'll need a backtrace with both pidgin-debuginfo and libsilc-debuginfo\ninstalled to be able to get anywhere with this.",

        "This appears to be a libsilc problem, could you please try this libsilc package\nto see if the crash is fixed, and if you are now able to log in to silc?http://koji.fedoraproject.org/scratch/nosnilmot/task_328484/",
        "This seems to solve the problem for me. Now I can log in to silc without\ncrashing pidgin anymore.",
