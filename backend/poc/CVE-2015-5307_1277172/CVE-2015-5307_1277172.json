        "It was found that a guest can DoS a host by triggering an infinite loop in microcode. If a guest in 32-bit mode enabled alignment exceptions, puts the exception handler in ring 3, and then triggers an alignment exception with an unaligned stack, then the microcode will enter an infinite loop. Because there's no instruction boundary the core never receives another interrupt (including SMIs). The host kernel panics pretty quickly due to the effects.\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel\nresulting in DoS.\n\nUpstream KVM patch:\n-------------------\n  ->http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2082329References:\n-----------\n  ->http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/11/10/1",

        "(In reply to Mohammed Gamal fromcomment #10)> I noticed that the proposed patch only fixes Intel VMX code.

The final patch that will be included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux updates fixes both VMX and SVM code.",
