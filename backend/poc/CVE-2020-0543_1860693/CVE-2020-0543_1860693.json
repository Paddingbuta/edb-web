Grab the latest OS updates via \nsudo dnf update \nor\nGnome Software\n2. Download the Meltdown OVH script via:\nwgethttps://meltdown.ovh-O spectre-meltdown-checker.sh\n3. Run the script as sudo.\n\nActual results:CVE-2020-0543aka 'Special Register Buffer Data Sampling (SRBDS)'\n* Mitigated according to the /sys interface:  NO  (Vulnerable: No microcode)\n* SRBDS mitigation control is supported by the kernel:  YES  (found SRBDS implementation evidence in kernel image. Your kernel is up to date for SRBDS mitigation)\n* SRBDS mitigation control is enabled and active:  NO> STATUS:  VULNERABLE  (Your CPU microcode may need to be updated to mitigate the vulnerability)Expected results:\n\nThe CPU should not be vulnerable after microcode update.
