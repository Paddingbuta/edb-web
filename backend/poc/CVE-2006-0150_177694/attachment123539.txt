Name        : auth_ldap
Versions    : rh7.3: auth_ldap-1.6.0-4.2.legacy
Summary     : This is an LDAP authentication module for Apache.
Description :
This is an authentication module for Apache that allows you to authenticate
HTTP clients using user entries in an LDAP directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

An updated auth_ldap package that fixes a format string security issue is
now available for testing for Red Hat Linux 7.3.

This issue has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

The auth_ldap package is an httpd module that allows user authentication
against information stored in an LDAP database.

A format string flaw was found in the way auth_ldap logs information. It
may be possible for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the
'apache' user if auth_ldap is used for user authentication. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name
CVE-2006-0150 to this issue.

Note that this issue only affects servers that have auth_ldap installed and
configured to perform user authentication against an LDAP database.

All users of auth_ldap should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to resolve this issue.

This issue does not affect Red Had Linux 9, Fedora Core 1, 2 or 3 distri-
butions as they do not include the auth_ldap package.
