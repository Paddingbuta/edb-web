        "Qemu VGA module allows guest to edit certain registers in 'vbe' and 'vga' \nmodes. ie. guest could set certain 'VGA' registers while in 'VBE' mode. This \nleads to potential integer overflow or OOB read access issues in Qemu, \n\nA privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the \nhost resulting in DoS.\n\nUpstream patches:\n-----------------\n  ->https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-05/msg01198.htmlReference:\n----------\n  ->http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/05/09/4",

RHEL-5 gets theCVE-2016-3710fix only so no regression there.\n\nPatches are out for 6.8 and 7.2.z.",
