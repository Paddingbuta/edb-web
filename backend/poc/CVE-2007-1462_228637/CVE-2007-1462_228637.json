        "The password for the remote system(s) is persisted between two page loads in\nthe Add System/Cluster task flow. If it were persisted in the server session it\nwould not be a problem, but instead it it is returned to the browser as a\n'Value' attribute in a password entry field widget. This means that if the user\nwere to 'View Source', the password would appear as plaintext in the html.\n\nNOTE: All luci interaction is done via HTTPS; still this does present a remote,\nbut possible means of exploit.",
