        "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifierCVE-2010-1917to\nthe following vulnerability:\n\nStack consumption vulnerability in PHP 5.2 through 5.2.13 and 5.3 through\n5.3.2 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service\n(PHP crash) via a crafted first argument to the fnmatch function, as\ndemonstrated using a long string.\n\nReferences:\n  [1]http://www.php-security.org/2010/05/11/mops-2010-021-php-fnmatch-stack-exhaustion-vulnerability/index.html[2]http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/58585",

        "Upstream patch:http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=298881This flaw is similar toCVE-2007-4782(seebug #285881), which covered similar problem for string rather than pattern fnmatch() argument.  Matching pattern is less likely to by exposed to untrusted inputs than string to match pattern against.\n\nAs with the previous CVE, this is not really a PHP flaw, rather a PHP-exposed glibc unsafe alloca() use.  PHP fix adds additional input argument size limits which works around this bug.",

        "Statement:\n\nThis issue is not planned to be fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 due to this product being in Production 3 of its maintenance life-cycle, where only qualified security errata of important and critical impact are addressed.\n\nFor further information about the Errata Support Policy, visit:http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/errata"
