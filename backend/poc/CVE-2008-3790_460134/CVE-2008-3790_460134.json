        "Ruby upstream has reported a security vulnerability present in the\nRuby REXML module. The REXML engine is vulnerable to the \"XML entity explosion\" attack. This issue could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service by \nattempting to parse a XML file with recursively nested entities via the\nRuby XML files parsing engine (REXML).\n\nReferences:http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/08/23/dos-vulnerability-in-rexml/http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/browse_thread/thread/19f69e8a081fc0d1/e138e014b74352ca?#e138e014b74352ca",
