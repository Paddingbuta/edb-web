        "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nEmulation routines in the hypervisor dealing with certain system\ndevices check whether the access size by the guest is a supported one.\nWhen the access size is unsupported these routines failed to set the\ndata to be returned to the guest for read accesses, so that hypervisor\nstack contents are copied into the destination of the operation, thus\nbecoming visible to the guest.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nA malicious HVM guest might be able to read sensitive data relating\nto other guests.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen 3.2.x and later are vulnerable.\nXen 3.1.x and earlier have not been inspected.\n\nOnly HVM guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.\n\nOnly x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nRunning only PV guests will avoid this issue.",
