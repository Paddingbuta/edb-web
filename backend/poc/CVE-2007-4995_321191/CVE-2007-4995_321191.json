        "The OpenSSL team reported a flaw in OpenSSL DTLS support (introduced in OpenSSL\n0.9.8) that could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\nThis will only affect OpenSSL with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, not earlier\nversions.  We don't ship any client or server that uses DTLS by default.\n\nWe need to investigate the technical nature of the flaw to determine if the flaw\nis captured by the various technologies in OpenSSL.  \n\nCurrently embargoed, public date not yet set.",
