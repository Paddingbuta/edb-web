        "A flaw was found in the way ssl.match_hostname() from the Python SSL module checked the hostname's identity when handling certificates that contain hostnames with NULL bytes. An attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof SSL servers. Note that to exploit this issue, an attacker would need to obtain a carefully-crafted certificate signed by an authority that the client trusts.\n\nReferences:http://bugs.python.org/issue18709http://bugs.python.org/file31241/CVE-2013-4073_py34.patchhttp://bugs.python.org/file31242/CVE-2013-4073_py33.patchhttp://bugs.python.org/file31243/CVE-2013-4073_py27.patch",
