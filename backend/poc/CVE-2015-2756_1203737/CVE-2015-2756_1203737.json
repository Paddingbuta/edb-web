        "ISSUE DESCRIPTION\n=================\n\nHVM guests are currently permitted to modify the memory and I/O decode\nbits in the PCI command register of devices passed through to them.\nUnless the device is an SR-IOV virtual function, subsequent accesses to\nthe respective MMIO or I/O port ranges would - on PCI Express devices -\nlead to Unsupported Request responses. The treatment of such errors is\nplatform specific.\n\nIMPACT\n======\n\nIn the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses as\nNon-Maskable Interrupts, and either the OS is configured to treat NMIs\nas fatal or (e.g. via ACPI's APEI) the platform tells the OS to treat\nthese errors as fatal, the host would crash, leading to a Denial of\nService.\n\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS\n==================\n\nXen versions 3.3 and onwards are vulnerable due to supporting PCI\npass-through.\n\nOnly x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable.\n\nOnly HVM guests with their device model run in Dom0 can take advantage\nof this vulnerability.\n\nAny domain which is given access to a non-SR-IOV virtual function PCI\nExpress device can take advantage of this vulnerability.\n\nMITIGATION\n==========\n\nThis issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI Express devices other\nthan SR-IOV virtual functions to untrusted HVM guests. This issue can\nalso be avoided by only using PV guests or HVM guests with their\ndevice model run in a separate (stub) domain.\n\nRESOLUTION\n==========\n\nApplying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.",
