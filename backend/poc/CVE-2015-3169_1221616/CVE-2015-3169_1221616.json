        "A cross-site scripting flaw was found in AskBot, a question and answer forum written in Python and Django.\n\nThe flaw can be triggered by appending, for example:\n\n?sort=%3C/SCript%3E%3CsvG/onLoad=prompt%289%29%3E \n\nto a question page on a vulnerable AskBot deployment.\n\nThis flaw is reported to be fixed in the latest release of AskBot, though it is unclear which one that is. askbot-0.7.51-4.el6.noarch is definitely vulnerable. The upstream changelog is not up-to-date:http://askbot.org/doc/changelog.html",
