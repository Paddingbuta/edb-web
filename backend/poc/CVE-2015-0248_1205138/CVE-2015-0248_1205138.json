        "Summary:\n========\n\n  Subversion's mod_dav_svn and svnserve servers will trigger an assertion\n  while processing some requests with special parameters, which are evaluated\n  on the server side.  Assertion will cause svnserve process or the process\n  hosting mod_dav_svn module (Apache) to abort.\n\n  This can lead to a DoS.  There are no known instances of this problem\n  being exploited in the wild, but an exploit has been tested.\n\nDetails:\n========\n\n  Subversion's http:// and svn:// protocol support includes certain request\n  types with parameters, which are evaluated on the server side.  As an\n  example, sometimes clients need to trace the history of the object to its\n  origin, while not knowing the exact value of the origin (revision number)\n  prior to issuing the request.\n\n  Certain parameter combinations can exploit this behavior and force a server\n  into attempting an operation with invalid arguments.  Subversion servers\n  guard against these situations with assertion statements, and the default\n  behavior for a failed assertion is to abort the current process.\n\nSeverity:\n=========\n\n  CVSSv2 Base Score: 5.0\n  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P\n\n  We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability.\n\n  Apache HTTPD servers with repositories that allow anonymous reads will be\n  vulnerable without authentication.  Many Apache servers will respawn the\n  listener processes, but a determined attacker will be able to crash these\n  processes as they appear, denying service to legitimate users.  Servers\n  using threaded MPMs will close the connection on other clients being\n  served by the same process that services the request from the attacker.\n  In either case there is an increased processing impact of restarting a\n  process and the cost of per process caches being lost.\n\n  Exploiting this behavior against svnserve does not require an attacker to\n  authenticate.  A remote attacker can cause svnserve process to terminate\n  and thus deny service to users of the server.\n\n  Unfortunately, no special configuration is required and all mod_dav_svn\n  and svnserve servers are vulnerable.\n\nRecommendations:\n================\n\n  No known workarounds are available.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue.
