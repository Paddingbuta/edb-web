        "The Xerces-C XML parser mishandles certain kinds of malformed input documents, resulting in a segmentation fault during a parse operation. The bug does not appear to allow for remote code execution, but is a denial of service attack that in many applications may allow for an unauthenticated attacker to supply malformed input and cause a crash.\n\nSuggested upstream patch is attached to this Bugzilla.",

        "Is there any kind of timeline on this? My community is left hanging, and it's been an unacceptably long period of time to leave a bug this serious unpatched.\n\nI did a lot of work to get this fix out there from upstream, when that project was essentially dead, and this isn't really making me feel like it was worth my time.",

        "Hello Scott,\n\nI apologize for the delay - this has been handled unusually long. This issue has been stalled three times in various stages of our process due to extraordinary complications. I am going to do a postmortem now and make sure these are documented and addressed in the future.\n\nThank you !",
        "Thank you for getting the fix out, and for responding. I'm glad that at least this wasn't a routine situation."
