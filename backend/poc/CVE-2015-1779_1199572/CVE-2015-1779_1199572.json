        "It was found that the QEMU's websocket frame decoder processed incoming frames without limiting resources used to process the header and payload. An attacker able to access a guest's VNC console could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service on the host by exhausting all available memory and CPU.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nThis issue was discovered by Daniel P. Berrange of Red Hat.",
