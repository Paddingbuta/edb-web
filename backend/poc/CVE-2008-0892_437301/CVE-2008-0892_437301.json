        "Richard Megginson discovered a shell command injection flaw in the Admin\nServer's replication monitor CGI perl script repl-monitor-cgi.pl.  Script\nparameters were not properly sanitized prior to being passed to system()\nfunction.  An attacker able to access replication monitor CGI script could\nexecute arbitrary shell command with privileges of Admin Server.\n\nAffected versions:\n- Red Hat Directory Server 7.1\n  - Admin Server runs with root privileges\n- Red Hat Directory Server 8\n  - Admin Server runs under an unprivileged user, following users by default:\n    - nobody on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Solaris\n    - daemon on HP-UX\n- Fedora Directory Server\n  - Admin Server runs under an unprivileged user, nobody by default",
        "For RHDS7.1:\ncvss2=7.7/AV:A/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C\n\nFor RHDS8 and FDS8 the CVSSv2 score is lowered to \ncvss2=5.2/AV:A/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P",
