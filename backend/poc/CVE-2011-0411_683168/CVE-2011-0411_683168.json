        "Createdattachment 484139[details]Experimental test script\n\nRunning it on production system is not recommended - the cleaning phase is very vague and it doesn't bring your system to the state before test.\n\nUsage: you need repos for binary RPMs and sources. If the SRPM repo is disabled, it will be temporally enabled during the test. The test takes a while, because it creates reproducer from the openssl package and recompiles it, then it installs it with the release number set to 99 (it is left on your system after the test, you can return to the distro version by e.g. yum downgrade openssl). The script returns 0 on PASS (the bug was not reproduced) or 1 on FAIL (the bug was reproduced) or 2 in case there were error(s) while setting up the testing environment.",
