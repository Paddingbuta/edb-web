        "Note that the Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having\ncritical security impact.\n\n+++ This bug was initially created as a clone ofBug #177042+++\n\niDEFENSE has reported a format string flaw in mod_auth_pgsql.  This could allow\na remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as the httpd process.\n\n-- Additional comment from bressers on 2006-01-05 13:12 EST --\nThis issue should also affect RHEL2.1 and RHEL3\n\n-- Additional comment from mjc on 2006-01-05 13:34 EST --\nRHEL2.1 uses version 0.9.9 of mod_auth_pgsql which uses different a different\nmechanism for logging of failures and is not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n-- Additional comment from bressers on 2006-01-05 21:38 EST --\nThis issue is public:http://www.giuseppetanzilli.it/mod%5Fauth%5Fpgsql2/-- Additional comment from bugzilla on 2006-01-05 21:46 EST --\n\nAn advisory has been issued which should help the problem\ndescribed in this bug report. This report is therefore being\nclosed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information\non the solution and/or where to find the updated files,\nplease follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report\nif the solution does not work for you.http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0164.html",
        "This *may* not affect RHL 7.3 and RHL 9, as both of those use\nmod_auth_pgsql-0.9.12-x versions.  RHEL 2.1 uses version 0.9.9 of \nmod_auth_pgsql, which RedHat says (above) is not vulnerable to this issue.  We\nwill need to look into this.\n\nFrom RHSA-2006-0164:\n\n\"Several format string flaws were found in the way mod_auth_pgsql logs\ninformation.  It may be possible for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary\ncode as the 'apache' user if mod_auth_pgsql is used for user\nauthentication. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned\nthe nameCVE-2005-3656to this issue.\n\n\"Please note that this issue only affects servers which have mod_auth_pgsql\ninstalled and configured to perform user authentication against a\nPostgreSQL database.\n\n\"All users of mod_auth_pgsql should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue.\n\n\"This issue does not affect the mod_auth_pgsql package supplied with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 2.1.\"",
        "I checked 0.9.9 and a diff against 0.9.12.  0.9.* use ap_log_reason function for\nlogging these messages\n(http://httpd.apache.org/dev/apidoc/apidoc_ap_log_reason.html), instead of\nap_log_rerror.  The latter expects a format string argument, the former doesn't.\nI saw no significant changes between 0.9.9 and 0.9.12 in this respect.\n\nTherefore I'm fairly confident that if 0.9.9 is unaffected, 0.9.12 also is.\n\nFC1 and FC2 work is needed, though, but the patch should be trivial.",
