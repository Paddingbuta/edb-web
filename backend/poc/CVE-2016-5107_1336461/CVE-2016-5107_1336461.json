        "Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read access issue. It could occur while looking up MegaRAID Firmware Interface(MFI) command frames in 'megasas_lookup_frame' routine.\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to read invalid memory leading to crash the Qemu process on the host.\n\nUpstream patch:\n---------------\n  ->https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-05/msg04424.htmlReference:\n----------\n  ->http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/05/25/7",
