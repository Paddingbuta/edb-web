        "A pointer use-after-free flaw was found in the OpenSSL's Datagram TLS (DTLS)\nimplementation. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice (s_client crash) by establishing a fake OpenSSL's s_server with\na specially-crafted X509.v3 certificate file.\n\nCredit: Daniel Mentz\n\nReferences:http://marc.info/?l=openssl-dev&m=124202891602690&w=2http://xorl.wordpress.com/2009/05/18/cve-2009-1379-dtls-fragment-read-after-free/",
