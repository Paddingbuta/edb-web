        "There is a private function in libcurl called `fix_hostname()` that removes a\ntrailing dot from the host name if there is one. The function is called after\nthe host name has been extracted from the URL libcurl has been told to act on.\n\nIf a URL is given with a zero-length host name, like in \"http://:80\" or just\n\":80\", `fix_hostname()` will index the host name pointer with a -1 offset (as\nit blindly assumes a non-zero length) and both read and assign that address.\n\nAt best, this gets unnoticed but can also lead to a crash or worse. We have\nnot researched further what kind of malicious actions that potentially this\ncould be used for.\n\nWe are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.\n\nAffected versions: from libcurl 7.37.0 to and including 7.41.0\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Daniel Stenberg (curl upstream) for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Hanno B\u00f6ck as the original reporter.",
