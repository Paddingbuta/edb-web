        "Description of problem:\n\nFrom Nathan Rosenblum <nater.edu>:\n\nI have identified a bug in the linux kernel \nthat causes this kernel panic on my machine. More details are below, but \nthe executive summary is this: the code that triggers the bug appears to \nhave been eliminated in 2.6.11.12, but I have not tested on the \nintervening releases between 2.6.9 and that version, so I cannot \nguarantee that it was not fixed previous to 2.6.11.12.  It is unclear \nwhether the developer that made the change in that version was aware of \nthe severity of the problem, or even if a problem existed; the commit \ncomments suggest that the change was only cleanup.  This is apparently \nleft-over debugging code that is stripped out in 2.6.11.12.\n\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n\n2.6.9-34.EL\n\nHow reproducible:\n\nAlways\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\nSee attachments\n  \nActual results:\n\nCrashed kernel\n\nExpected results:\n\nRunning kernel",
