        "The following flaw was reported in wpa_supplicant:\n\nA vulnerability was found in EAP-pwd peer implementation used in wpa_supplicant. If an EAP-pwd Confirm message is received unexpectedly before the Identity exchange, the error path processing ended up dereferencing a NULL pointer and terminating the process.\n\nFor wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd enabled in a network configuration profile, this could allow a denial of service attack by an attacker within radio range.\n\nVulnerable versions/configurations:\n\nwpa_supplicant v1.0-v2.5 with CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration (wpa_supplicant/.config) and EAP-pwd enabled in a network profile at runtime.\n\nPossible mitigation steps\n\n- Disable EAP-pwd in runtime configuration\n\nExternal References:http://w1.fi/security/2015-8/",

        "Affected code does not exist in wpa_supplicant versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier. The wpa_supplicant packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Fedora are not built with the CONFIG_EAP_PWD configuration option and hence are also unaffected.\n\nStatement:\n\nNot vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7."
