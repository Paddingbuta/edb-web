        "A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack:\n\nTitle: S3Token TLS cert verification option not honored\nReporter: Brant Knudson (IBM)\nProducts: keystonemiddleware, python-keystoneclient\nAffects: versions up to 1.5.0 (keystonemiddleware),\n         versions up to 0.11.2 (python-keystoneclient)\n\nDescription:\nBrant Knudson from IBM reported a vulnerability in keystonemiddleware\n(formerly shipped as python-keystoneclient). When the 'insecure' option\nis set in a S3Token paste configuration file its value is effectively\nignored and instead assumed to be true. As a result certificate\nverification will be disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM\nattacks. Note that it's unusual to explicitly add this option and then\nset it to false, so the impact of this bug is thought to be limited. All\nversions of s3_token middleware with TLS settings configured are\naffected by this flaw.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Brant Knudson from IBM as the original reporter.",
