        "The Django project reports the following issue:\n\n\"\"\"\nDjango relies on user input in some cases (e.g. ``django.contrib.auth.views.login()`` and i18n) to redirect the user to an \"on success\" URL. The security checks for these redirects (namely ``django.util.http.is_safe_url()``) didn't strip leading whitespace on the tested URL and as such considered URLs like ``\\njavascript:...`` safe. If a developer relied on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect targets and put such a URL into a link, they could suffer from a XSS attack. This bug doesn't affect Django currently, since we only put this URL into the ``Location`` response header and browsers seem to ignore JavaScript there.\n\"\"\"\n\nThis issue is resolved in the upstream versions 1.7.3, 1.6.10, and 1.4.18. Note that Django 1.5 is no longer receiving security updates.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this issue.",
