        "Upstream has reported the below security vulnerability in Subversion:\n\nSummary\n=======\n\n  Subversion servers, both httpd and svnserve, will reveal some paths\n  that should be hidden by path-based authz.  When a node is copied\n  from an unreadable location to a readable location the unreadable\n  path may be revealed.  This vulnerablity only reveals the path, it\n  does not reveal the contents of the path.\n\nKnown vulnerable\n================\n\n  Subversion 1.8.0 to 1.8.13\n  Subversion 1.7.0 to 1.7.20\n  All older versions\n\nKnown fixed\n===========\n\n  Subversion 1.8.14\n  Subversion 1.7.21\n\nDetails\n=======\n\n  The function svn_repos_trace_node_locations() follows the history of\n  a node through earlier revisions and shows any copies.  It should\n  stop following history when an unreadable path is encountered but an\n  implementation error causes the first unreadable path to be returned\n  in some circumstances.  This only reveals the unreadable path, it\n  does not reveal the content of the file or directory at that path.\n  Any attempts to obtain the content will fail with an authorization\n  error.\n\n  Examples:\n\n  1. After copying \"unreadable-path\" to \"readable-path\" then following\n     the history of \"readable-path\" may reveal \"unreadable-path\".\n\n  2. After copying \"unreadable/some-path\" to \"readable/other-path\"\n     then following the history of \"readable/other-path\" may reveal\n     \"unreadable/some-path\".\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges C. Michael Pilato, CollabNet, as the original reporter.",
