        "Hello,\n\nwhile doing review of the Vulnerability Assessment report of RHEL 8.6 for the purpose of Common Criteria certification, we came across thisCVE-2015-3276. The CVE pagehttps://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3276does not even list RHEL 8. However, thecomment 10above mentions that the fix was rejected upstream.\n\nDo we still carry the patch downstream in RHEL 8 (RHEL 8.6 has openldap-2.4.46-16.el8)? Could the CVE page be updated with Red Hat's official statement about this CVE in RHEL 8?\n\nThank you, Jan",
        "This CVE is not applicable to RHEL8 (and later).\n\nopenldap package went back to using openssl for cryptographic purposes rather than the compatibility shim on top of nss that had the issue.",

        "Thanks but ... I was more after the short note of why we believe it to be so, similar to Martin'scomment 12? It would help us in communication with the external parties."
