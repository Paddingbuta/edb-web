        "It was discovered that Subversion's mod_dontdothat module and Subversion clients using http(s):// are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack caused by exponential XML entity expansion. \n\nAn authenticated remote attacker can cause denial-of-service conditions on the server using mod_dontdothat by sending a specially crafted REPORT request. The attack does not require access to a particular repository.\n\nIf an attacker has control over HTTP responses sent to a Subversion client, they can cause denial-of-service conditions on the client by injecting an XML bomb into the response.\n\nUpstream bug:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-4630",

        "There are two parts to this vulnerability:  server-side and client-side.\n\nThe client side vulnerability only affects subversion when built with the Serf WebDav library, not with the Neon WebDav library. Subversion for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7 is built with Neon, so it is not affected by the client-side vulnerability.\n\nThe server side vulnerability exists in mod_dontdothat, which was only moved from contrib into the standard release in subversion 1.7.3.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 do not build or ship mod_dontdothat.",
        "Mitigation:\n\nOnly Apache+Subversion servers that have the \"DontDoThatConfigFile\" configuration option present are affected by this flaw. This option is not enabled in default httpd or mod_dav_svn configuration as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.",
        "Created subversion tracking bugs for this issue:\n\nAffects: fedora-all [bug 1399871]"
