        "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifierCVE-2008-3659to\nthe following vulnerability:\n\nBuffer overflow in the memnstr function in PHP 4.4.x before 4.4.9 and PHP 5.2 through 5.2.6 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via the delimiter argument to the explode function. NOTE: the scope of this issue is limited since most applications would not use an attacker-controlled delimiter, but local attacks against safe_mode are feasible.\n\nReferences:http://www.php.net/archive/2008.php#id2008-08-07-1http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/13/8http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/08/4http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/08/3http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/08/2http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234102Upstream patch with test case:http://news.php.net/php.cvs/52002",
