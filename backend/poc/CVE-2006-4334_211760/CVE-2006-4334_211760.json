        "+++ This bug was initially created as a clone ofBug #207643+++\n\nDescription of problem:\nGoogle Security Team has dicovered multiple vunabilities in gzip 1.3.5. These\nvunabilities are recorded asCVE-2006-4334,CVE-2006-4335,CVE-2006-4336,CVE-2006-4337,CVE-2006-4338.\n\nVersion-Release number of selected component (if applicable):\n1.3.5  \n\nAdditional info:\nThese vunabilities are already fixed for Red Hats commercial linux\ndistributions. Where is the updated package for fedora core??\n\n-- Additional comment from varekova on 2006-09-22 11:51 EST --\nfixed in gzip-1.3.5-8.\n\n-- Additional comment from michal on 2006-09-26 15:34 EST --> fixed in gzip-1.3.5-8gzip-1.3.5-8 is from rawhide and this update indeed showed up there\nsome time ago.  But for FC5 gzip-1.3.5-7.1.fc5 sits for a number\nof days already in \"testing\" and released packages do not seem to be\nforthcoming.  Seebug 204676for a description of attacks.\n\n-- Additional comment from bressers on 2006-09-30 17:23 EST --\nIvana, it seems you forgot to push this one live, can you take care of it ASAP?\n\n-- Additional comment from varekova on 2006-10-10 03:30 EST --\nThe update gzip-1.3.5-7.1.fc5 is pushed as final now.\n\n-- Additional comment from redhat on 2006-10-12 16:22 EST --\ngzip 1.3.5-7.1 was pushed 2006-10-02\ngzip 1.3.5-7 was pushed 2006-10-10\n\nNote that the 10/02 version is later than the 10/10 version.\n\nDoes 1.3.5-7.1 have the relevant fix?\n\nOr does someone need to release a 1.3.5-7.2?\n\n-- Additional comment from matsuu on 2006-10-12 22:51 EST --\ngzip-1.3.3 also has these vulnerabilities. FC3 is affected. see RHSA-2006-0667\n\n\n-- Additional comment from bugzilla.net on 2006-10-13 01:17 EST --\nI noticed that 1.3.5-7.fc5 and 1.3.5-7.1.fc5 where made available for download\nin the opposite order of being build. So which one should I be using?\nIntuitively the extra .1 sounds like a higher version number. But\nlexicographically .1.fc5 is before .fc5, and neither have an epoch. Maybe I\nmisunderstood the algorithm for comparing version numbers, is it documented\nanywhere?\n\n-- Additional comment from varekova on 2006-10-13 10:31 EST --\nThe problem with update is fixed by 1.3.5-8.fc5\n\n-- Additional comment from bugzilla.net on 2006-10-14 20:03 EST --\nI don't see any gzip-1.3.5-8.fc5",
        "Thanks a bunch, ali, for noticing this issue and adding this bug.  I don't\nbelieve anybody has done any work on the gzip issue, so if you would backport\nfor FC3 and FC4, it would be most welcome!  :)\n\nThanks again!",
        "There isftp://ftp.harddata.com/pub/Legacy_srpms/gzip-1.3.5-6.1.mj.src.rpmwhich works as a replacement at least for FC4.  It is practically\nthe same as what showed up later as an update for FC5.\n\nAs for a quoted comment \"I don't see any gzip-1.3.5-8.fc5\"\nthen this version was released on October 16.  It does not differ\nfrom gzip-1.3.5-7.1.fc5, save a version markings, so presumably\nthis was done to make tracking easier between FC5 and FC6.\n\nThere are really no essential differences between various gzip\nversions in use.",
        "I've put up a SRPM and the patches I used to take gzip-1.3.5-6 to gzip-1.3.5-9\n(the current version from HEAD) athttp://www.cs.uwm.edu/~lomonaco/gzip.  The\nversion bumps in the changelog seem to be from rebuilds and the addition of the\nCVE patches, atleast from FC4.\n\nFC3 seems to have shipped with 1.3.3. I don't have access to any FC3 systems\nthough I'm sure the above mentioned SRPM will build on FC3.  Not sure the policy\non bumping versions on security fixes; seems to be the easiest route though.\n\nNot sure what the next step is...",
        "Hi Ali, and Michal,\n\nI apologize for not responding to your hard work before now.  (I started a\npost here then lost it before I could hit the <SEND> button a couple of days\nago.  Argh!)  I will take what you have (after a little bit of review), build it\non the build server, and push it out to updates-testing.  (Jesse Keating, Legacy\nProject lead, has recently given me the ability to push things.)\n\nDocumentation on how packages have in the past been submitted for pushing to\nupdates, Ali, can be found here, though it appears the Legacy project may be\nin the process of making some changes to that process:\n<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legacy/QATesting> under \"Submitting Packages.\"\n\nThe community has been talking about removing the \"QA Publish\" step, and just\naccepting what folks propose as updated .src.rpm packages to be pushed to\nupdates-testing.  Because of this, and because of an IRC conversation I had\nwith Jesse Keating about it a day or two ago, I guess we will go ahead and skip\nthis step, though I personally will take a moment to look at what you've\nsubmitted before adding it to Legacy's CVS and pushing it to updates-testing. \nIn this way, Fedora Legacy will reduce the QA burden down to the level done by\nthe Fedora Core project, hopefully making it less cumbersome for contributors\nlike you to contribute.\n\nThank you both for your contributions and enthusiasm!  We really need it! :)",
        "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nAli - looked over the .src.rpm you submitted and it was good.  Only made a\ncouple of changes to the spec file.  One of the changes was to change the\nName-Version-Release from 'gzip-1.3.5-9' to 'gzip-1.3.5-6.1.0.legacy' so\nthat:\n\n  1)  there would be no upgrade versioning problems when a FC4 user upgrades\n      to FC5 ... that is, the versioning of gzip is\n        - gzip-1.3.5-6     for FC4 (currently),\n        - gzip-1.3.5-6.2.1 for FC5 gold, and\n        - gzip-1.3.5-8     for FC5 (version that fixes these security bugs).\n      Were FC4 users to install a 'gzip-1.3.5-9' package, then they would\n      not be able to properly upgrade that package if they attempted to up-\n      grade to FC5.\n\n  2)  the package would be recognizable by its name as a Fedora Legacy\n      package, rather than a package created by the Fedora Core developers/\n      maintainers.\n\nOne other change was to add your name (and email) to the changelog so that\nyou would get proper attribution for your work and so folks would know who\nto contact if they had questions.  I added my name also, but goofed in ad-\nding my email; but the powers-that-be said it was probably okay -- this time.\n(\"Just don't let it happen again!\" said they.  hehe)\n\nAttached is the output of the 'rpm-build-compare.sh' script on your pack-\nage and my pacakge to see the differences.
