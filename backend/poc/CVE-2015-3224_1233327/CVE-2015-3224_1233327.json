        "There is a remote code execution vulnerability in Web Console.\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifierCVE-2015-3224.\n\nVersions Affected:  All\nNot affected:       Environments inaccessible from remote IPs, or without Web Console enabled\nFixed Versions:     2.1.3\n\nImpact \n------ \nSpecially crafted remote requests can spoof their origin, bypassing the IP whitelist, in any environment where Web Console is enabled (development and test, by default).\n\nUsers whose application is only accessible from localhost (as is the default behaviour in Rails 4.2) are not affected, unless a local proxy is involved.\n\nWorkarounds \n----------- \nTo work around this issue, turn off web-console in all environments, by removing/commenting it from the application's Gemfile.\n\nThe patch against 2.1 series is attached.",
