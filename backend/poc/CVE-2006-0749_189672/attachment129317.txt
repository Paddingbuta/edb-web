Versions    : fc3: thunderbird-1.0.8-1.1.fc3.4.legacy
Summary     : Mozilla Thunderbird mail/newsgroup client
Description :
Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security bugs are now
available.

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several bugs were found in the way Thunderbird processes malformed
javascript. A malicious HTML mail message could modify the content of a
different open HTML mail message, possibly stealing sensitive information
or conducting a cross-site scripting attack. Please note that JavaScript
support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-1731,
CVE-2006-1732, CVE-2006-1741)

Several bugs were found in the way Thunderbird processes certain
javascript actions. A malicious HTML mail message could execute arbitrary
javascript instructions with the permissions of 'chrome', allowing the
page to steal sensitive information or install browser malware. Please
note that JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird.
(CVE-2006-0292, CVE-2006-0296, CVE-2006-1727, CVE-2006-1728, CVE-2006-1733,
CVE-2006-1734, CVE-2006-1735, CVE-2006-1742)

Several bugs were found in the way Thunderbird processes malformed HTML
mail messages. A carefully crafted malicious HTML mail message could
cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2006-0748, CVE-2006-0749, CVE-2006-1724, CVE-2006-1730, CVE-2006-1737,
CVE-2006-1738, CVE-2006-1739, CVE-2006-1790)

A bug was found in the way Thunderbird processes certain inline content
in HTML mail messages. It may be possible for a remote attacker to send a
carefully crafted mail message to the victim, which will fetch remote
content, even if Thunderbird is configured not to fetch remote content.
(CVE-2006-1045)

A bug was found in the way Thunderbird executes in-line mail forwarding. If
a user can be tricked into forwarding a maliciously crafted mail message as
in-line content, it is possible for the message to execute javascript with
the permissions of "chrome". (CVE-2006-0884)

Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to these updated packages
containing Thunderbird version 1.0.8, which is not vulnerable to these
issues.
