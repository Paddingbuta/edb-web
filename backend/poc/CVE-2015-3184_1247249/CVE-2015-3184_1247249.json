        "Below is the upstream report about a security issue in Subversion:\n\nSummary\n=======\n\n  Subversion's mod_authz_svn does not properly restrict anonymous\n  access in some mixed anonymous/authenticated environments when using\n  Apache httpd 2.4.  The result is that anonymous access may be possible\n  to files for which only authenticated access should be possible.\n\nKnown vulnerable\n================CVE-2015-3185Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.12CVE-2015-3184Apache Subversion 1.8.0 to 1.8.13CVE-2015-3184Apache Subversion 1.7.0 to 1.7.20\n\n  Servers are vulnerable if either httpd or Subversion is as listed.\n\n  Subversion 1.6 does not build with httpd 2.4 and servers using\n  httpd 2.2 are not vulnerable.  Servers that are configured to deny\n  anonymous access are not vulnerable.\n\nKnown fixed\n===========\n\n  Apache httpd 2.4.13\n  Apache Subversion 1.8.14 and 1.7.21\n\n  Both httpd and Subversion need to be updated.\n\nDetails\n=======\n\n  If you have a Subversion repository configured for anonymous read\n  that has mod_authz_svn configured such that some portion of the\n  repository is hidden from an anonymous user, then in certain cases\n  when Subversion is used with Apache httpd 2.4.x the file contents of\n  the repository may be exposed to someone who knows the path name\n  within the repository.  The protected files and directories will not\n  show on directory listings.  Protected directories that do not show\n  in their parent will return an empty directory listing rather than a\n  403 error.  Protected files will return the full content of the\n  file.  Specifically the conditions required for this to happen is\n  that there needs to be a <Directory> block for the DocumentRoot\n  allowing access to everyone (e.g. Require all granted) and \"Satisfy\n  any\" must not be set.  This sort of configuration is included in the\n  default httpd.conf that `make install` provides and is fairly\n  standard.\n\nSeverity\n========\n\n  CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.3\n  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N\n\n  The repository needs to be configured with mixed anonymous and\n  authenticated path-based authz and the the attacker needs to know\n  the paths to files in the repository that require authentication.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges C. Michael Pilato, CollabNet, as the original reporter.\n\nStatement:\n\nThis issue did not affect versions of subversion as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.",
