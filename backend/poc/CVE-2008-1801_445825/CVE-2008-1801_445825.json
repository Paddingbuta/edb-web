        "iDefense published advisory affecting rdesktop:\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nRemote exploitation of an integer underflow vulnerability in rdesktop, as\nincluded in various vendors' operating system distributions, allows attackers\nto execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-in user.\n\nThe vulnerability exists within the code responsible for reading in an RDP\nrequest. When reading a request, a 16-bit integer value that represents the\nnumber of bytes that follow is taken from the packet. This value is then\ndecremented by 4, and used to calculate how many bytes to read into a heap\nbuffer. The subtraction operation can underflow, which will then lead to the\nheap buffer being overflowed.\n\nANALYSIS:\nExploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the logged in user. In order to exploit this\nvulnerability, an attacker must persuade a targeted user to connect to a\nmalicious RDP server. \n\nReference:http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=696Upstream patch:http://rdesktop.cvs.sourceforge.net/rdesktop/rdesktop/iso.c?r1=1.19&r2=1.20",

        "As for CVSSv2 score, two possibilities should be considered.  User needs to be\nconvinced to connect to untrusted RDP server for this issue to be exploited. \nThis is lot more likely to happen if malicious RDP server is within some local\nnetwork (AV:A/AC:M) and not so likely for random RDP server in the Internet\n(AV:N/AC:H), hence Internet vector should have higher access complexity.\n\nAV:A/AC:M results in higher base score of:\n5.4/AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P",
