By disabling DNSSEC validation you open your resolver to DNS spoofing attacks and other attacks that the plain DNS suffers from.",
        "Of course, disabling DNSSEC validation opens up resolution to the classic DNS weaknesses.  That's why it was noted as likely undesired, and why upstream knowledge base also discourages the use of such workaround instead of applying patches.  It should only be considered a short-term mitigation before updates can be deployed.\n\nA possible consideration when evaluating this workaround is which issue has a greater risk of being exploited.  Spoofing attacks against setups with validation disabled would require attacker to be MITM (man in the middle) or able to efficiently predict or guess request ports and transaction IDs.  For issues as this DoS, it should be sufficient for attacker to force resolution of name in a domain they control.  That can be done directly if attacker is allowed to resolve host names via target server, or indirectly by forcing some authorized client to do resolution (e.g. by making users visit attacker controlled web page, or making some network service, such as mail server, resolve attacker supplied name).",
