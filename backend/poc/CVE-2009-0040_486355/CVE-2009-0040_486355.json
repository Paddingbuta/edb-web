        "A flaw was discovered in libpng that could result in libpng trying to free() random memory if certain unlikely error conditions occur.  To quote the libpng advisory:\n\n    If the application runs out of memory during the\n    loop, some of the element pointers will be uninitialized.\n    Libpng will then longjmp to a cleanup process that\n    attempts to free all of the elements in the array,\n    including the uninitialized ones.  This behavior\n    could be forced by a malevolent input.",
