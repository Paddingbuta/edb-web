        "Richard Megginson discovered that Admin Server as used by Red Hat Directory\nServer 8 and Fedora Directory Server does not properly restrict access to CGI\nscripts.  This could allow unauthenticated user to get access to information or\nperform tasks that should be restricted to authenticated administrative users.",
