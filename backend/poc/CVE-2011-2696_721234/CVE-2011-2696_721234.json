        "An integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libsndfile, library for reading and writing of sound files, processed certain PARIS Audio Format (PAF) audio files with crafted count of channels in the PAF file header. A remote attacker could provided a specially-crafted PAF audio file, which once opened by a local, unsuspecting user in an application, linked against libsndfile could lead to that particular application crash (denial of service), or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.\n\nReferences:\n[1]https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=375125[2]http://www.securelist.com/en/advisories/45125[3]http://secunia.com/advisories/45125/[4]http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/Relevant upstream patch (from Bzr log, local copy will be attached later too):\n\nrevno: 1610\ncommitter: Erik de Castro Lopo <erikd>\nbranch nick: libsndfile-dev\ntimestamp: Wed 2011-07-06 19:40:05 +1000\nmessage:\n  Fix for Secunia Advisory SA45125, heap overflow in PAF file handler.",

The heap gets overwritten with zeros which would\ncertainly lead to the application segfaulting. However, there is\nno way for arbitrary code to be executed on amy sane OS with proper\nmemory protection.\n\nFurthermore, Secunia when they contacted me about this said they would\nrelease information about this vulernability on the 18th and then ended\nup releasing it on the 12th instead which means I had to rush out the\nrelease I was working on (and would have easily had ready for the\n18th). That is not the way to win friends and influence people.\n\nRegards,\nErik\n--\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nErik de Castro Lopohttp://www.mega-nerd.com/=======================================\n\nThus have adjusted the impact and severity of this issue appropriately.",
