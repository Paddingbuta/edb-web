        "An uninitialized data structure flaw was found in lasso, a library that implements SSO standards. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash an application using the lasso library.\n\nThe lasso library is used by ipsilon and mod_auth_mellon.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nThis issue was discovered by Rob Crittenden of Red Hat.",
