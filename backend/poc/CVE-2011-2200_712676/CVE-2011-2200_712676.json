        "It was found that D-BUS message bus service / messaging facility did not\nupdate the byte-order flag of the message properly by swapping the byte\norder of incoming messages into their native endiannes. A local, authenticated\nuser could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted message to a system\nservice (like Avahi or NetworkManager), using the system bus, potentially\nleading to disconnect of such a service from system bus (denial of service).\n\nReferences:\n[1]http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=629938[2]https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38120Upstream patches:\n[3]http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/commit/?h=dbus-1.2&id=6519a1f77c61d753d4c97efd6e15630eb275336e(in upstream v1.2.28 version)\n\n[4]http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/commit/?h=dbus-1.4&id=c3223ba6c401ba81df1305851312a47c485e6cd7(in upstream v1.4.12 version)",
