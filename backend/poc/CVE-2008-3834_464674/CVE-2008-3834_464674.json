        "Upstream bug report:https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17803It is likely possible to send a message with a malformed signature which would cause the bus (or in general any process using libdbus to receive messages) to abort.",
        "Do you know what versions of dbus are affected by this?",
        "This code dates at least as far back as:\n\ncommit 5e389fdf499c39926c61b47fcafb5e71291ce1a2\nAuthor: John (J5) Palmieri <johnp>\nDate:   Wed Jun 15 15:15:32 2005 +0000",
        "According to brew the first build of dbus in RHEL is 2006, so I think this affects both EL4 and EL5.  Does not affect EL3 or earlier as I don't believe DBus is shipped there.",
        "By the way I could use some hand-holding with respect to how this should be handled upstream, things like if/how I allocate a CVE, etc.\n\nNote the bug was filed publicly so we can't embargo or anything like that.",
        "Ping on this - I'd like to do a new upstream release with the fix and could use advice on how to do the announcement and CVE etc.",
        "Sorry, I let this one slip through the cracks.  We'll deal with it next week.",
        "I've assignedCVE-2008-3834to this, and I'm moving this bug to the security-response product.",
