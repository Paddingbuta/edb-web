        "The following flaw was reported in Subversion:\n\nSubversion servers and clients are vulnerable to a remotely triggerable heap-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read caused by an integer overflow in the svn:// protocol parser.\n\nThis allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code under the context of the targeted process.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Ivan Zhakov of VisualSVN as the original reporter.",
