        "The following flaw was found in Active Record:\n\nDue to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way that JSON parameters are parsed, it is possible for an attacker to issue unexpected database queries with \"IS NULL\" or empty where clauses. This issue does *not* let an attacker insert arbitrary values into an SQL query, however they can cause the query to check for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause when most users wouldn't expect it.\n\nThis issue only affects the 4.2.x versions of Active Record.",
