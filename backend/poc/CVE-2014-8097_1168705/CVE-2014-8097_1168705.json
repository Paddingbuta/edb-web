        "ProcDbeSwapBuffers() and SProcDbeSwapBuffers() DBE extension calls do not check that the lengths and/or indexes sent by the\nclient are within the bounds specified by the caller or the bounds of\nthe memory allocated to hold the request read from the client, so could\nread or write past the bounds of allocated memory while processing the\nrequest. These calls all occur only after a client has successfully\nauthenticated itself.\n\nIntroduced in X11R6.1 (1996).",
