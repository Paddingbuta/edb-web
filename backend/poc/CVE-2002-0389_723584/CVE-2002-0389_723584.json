        "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifierCVE-2002-0389to the following vulnerability:\n\nPipermail in Mailman stores private mail messages with predictable filenames in a world-executable directory, which allows local users to read private mailing list archives.\n\nReferences:\n[1]http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0389[2]http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=101902003314968&w=2[3]http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=100103&aid=474616&group_id=103[4]http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/8874.php[5]http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/4538Further references:\n[6]https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=418589[7]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=459530Proposed upstream solution:\n[8]http://www.list.org/mailman-install/node9.html(in the Warning part)",
        "Exact form of the upstream solution proposal (from [8]):\n========================================================\n\nWarning: If you're running Mailman on a shared multiuser system, and you have mailing lists with private archives, you may want to hide the private archive directory from other users on your system. In that case, you should drop the other execute permission (o-x) from the archives/private directory. However, the web server process must be able to follow the symbolic link in public directory, otherwise your public Pipermail archives will not work. To set this up, become root and run the following commands:\n\n# cd <prefix>/archives\n# chown <web-server-user> private\n# chmod o-x private\n\nYou need to know what user your web server runs as. It may be www, apache, httpd or nobody, depending on your server's configuration.",
        "This issue affects the versions of the mailman package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.\n\n--\n\nThis issue does NOT affect the versions of the mailman package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15. It has been corrected in mailman-2.1.13-4.fc14 already. Relevant Changelog entry:\n\n* Tue Jul 13 2010 Jan Kaluza <jkaluza> 3:2.1.13-4\n- #459530 - fix permissions of archives/private directory",
        "Createdattachment 514052[details]Relevant mailman-2.1.13-3 and mailman-2.1.13-4 SPEC file difference\n\nImplements the changes, suggested to be performed post mailman installation (steps described in that Warning)",
        "Statement:\n\n(none)",
