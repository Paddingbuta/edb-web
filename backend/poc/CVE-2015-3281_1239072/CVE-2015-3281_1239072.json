        "Information disclosure vulnerability was reported in HAproxy.\nDetails (quoting attached patch):\n\n The function buffer_slow_realign() was initially designed for requests\n only and did not consider pending outgoing data. This causes a problem\n when called on responses where data remain in the buffer, which may\n happen with pipelined requests when the client is slow to read data.\n \n The user-visible effect is that if less than <maxrewrite> bytes are\n present in the buffer from a previous response and these bytes cross\n the <maxrewrite> boundary close to the end of the buffer, then a new\n response will cause a realign and will destroy these pending data and\n move the pointer to what's believed to contain pending output data.\n Thus the client receives the crap that lies in the buffer instead of\n the original output bytes.\n \n This new implementation now properly realigns everything including the\n outgoing data which are moved to the end of the buffer while the input\n data are moved to the beginning.\n \n This implementation still uses a buffer-to-buffer copy which is not\n optimal in terms of performance and which should be replaced by a\n buffer switch later.\n\nThe proposed patch is attached to this Bugzilla.",
