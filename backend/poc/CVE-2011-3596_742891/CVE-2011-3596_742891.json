        "A denial of service flaw was found in the way Polipo, a lightweight caching web proxy, processed certain HTTP POST / PUT requests. If polipo was configured to allow remote client connections and particular host was allowed to connect to polipo server instance, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service (polipo daemon abort due to assertion failure) via specially-crafted HTTP POST / PUT request.\n\nReferences:\n[1]http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Oct/10[2]https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=385307",
