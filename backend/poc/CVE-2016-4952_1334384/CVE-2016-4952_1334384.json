        "Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VMWARE PVSCSI paravirtual SCSI bus emulation support is vulnerable to an OOB r/w access issue. It could occur while processing SCSI commands 'PVSCSI_CMD_SETUP_RINGS' or 'PVSCSI_CMD_SETUP_MSG_RING'.\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS.\n\nUpstream patch:\n---------------\n  ->https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-05/msg03774.htmlReference:\n----------\n  ->http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/05/23/1",
