        "iDefense published advisory affecting rdesktop:\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nRemote exploitation of a BSS overflow vulnerability in rdesktop, as included in\nvarious vendors' operating system distributions, allows attackers to execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-in user.\n\nThe vulnerability exists within the code responsible for reading in an RDP\nredirect request. This request is used to redirect an RDP connection from one\nserver to another. When parsing the redirect request, the rdesktop client reads\nseveral 32-bit integers from the request packet. These integers are then used\nto control the number of bytes read into statically allocated buffers. This\nresults in several buffers located in the BSS section being overflowed, which\ncan lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nANALYSIS:\nExploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the logged in user. In order to exploit this\nvulnerability, an attacker must persuade a targeted user to connect to a\nmalicious RDP server.\n\nReference:http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=697Upstream patch:http://rdesktop.cvs.sourceforge.net/rdesktop/rdesktop/rdp.c?r1=1.101&r2=1.102&pathrev=HEAD",
