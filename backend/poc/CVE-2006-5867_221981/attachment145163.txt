Hello,
fetchmail-6.3.6 was released a few days ago, fixing CVE-2006-5867.  This
is quite a mess (5 different issues in one CVE), and I'm not at all sure
how to deal with it.  It is more a set of behavior changes than security
fixes, although relevant to security, backporting any of the changes can
break user's tested configurations.

The upstream advisory is at
http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-SA-2006-02.txt .

The mentioned issues are:
> V1. sslcertck/sslfingerprint options should have implied "sslproto tls1"
>     in order to enforce TLS negotiation, but did not.
> V2. Even with "sslproto tls1" in the config, fetches would go ahead
>     in plain text if STLS/STARTTLS wasn't available (not advertised,
>     or advertised but rejected).
doesn't affect RHEL2.1, which doesn't support STARTTLS/STLS
affects RHEL[345], FC[56]

These are really "fetchmail didn't support any way to enforce use of
STARTTLS".  The documentation doesn't at all suggest sslcertck or
sslfingerprint imply "SSL encryption required".  As for "sslproto tls1",
its original meaning was "use TLS1 on imaps or pop3s connections (which
don't use STARTTLS)", even when STARTTLS was not supported at all; using
it to mean "if imaps or pop3s is not used, STARTTLS must succeed" is a
new behavior in fetchmail-6.3.6.

> V3. POP3 fetches could completely ignore all TLS options whether
>     available or not because it didn't reliably issue CAPA before
>     checking for STLS support - but CAPA is a requisite for STLS.
>     Whether or not CAPAbilities were probed, depended on the "auth"
>     option. (Fetchmail only tried CAPA if the auth option was not set at
>     all, was set to gssapi, kerberos, kerberos_v4, otp, or cram-md5.)
doesn't affect RHEL2.1, which doesn't support STARTTLS/STLS
affects RHEL[345], FC[56]

In addition, RHEL{2.1,3,4} are affected by a variant of this bug, where
GSSAPI, KRBv4, CRAM-MD5 and OTP authentication on POP3 are performed
only if CAPA is issued, and CAPA is issued only if the auth option is
not set at all.  Thus, e.g. "auth gssapi" would _disable_ use of GSSAPI,
and due to V4 cause plain-text authentication.

>     authentication had been configured.
affects RHEL[345], FC[56]


> V5. POP2 would not complain if strong authentication or TLS had been
>     requested.
affects RHEL[345], FC[56]

A "don't do that" problem IMHO.


So, my suggestions:
* update rawhide - a nobrainer
* update RHEL5 to 6.3.6, either for GA or as a zero-day update.
  Enforcing STARTTLS usage is an important feature and we won't be able
  to introduce the semantic changes into the release later.
* FC[56]: update to 6.3.6, I guess.
* RHEL<5: Ignore V1,V2,V5.  Fix V3,V4.
  I'd like to both fix the possibilities of MITM attacks and avoid any
  possibility of broken configurations, but we can't have both in these
  cases.
