        "It was reported that in vhost_scsi_make_tpg() the limit for \"tpgt\" is UINT_MAX but the data type of \"tpg->tport_tpgt\" and that is a u16.\n\nIn the context it turns out that in vhost_scsi_set_endpoint(), \"tpg->tport_tpgt\" is used as an offset into the vs_tpg[] array which has VHOST_SCSI_MAX_TARGET (256) elements, so anything higher than 255 then is invalid. Attached patch corrects this.\nIn vhost_scsi_send_evt() the values higher than 255 are masked, but now that the limit has changed, the mask is not needed.\n\nUpstream fix:http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg82650.htmlDiscussion:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/13/4",
