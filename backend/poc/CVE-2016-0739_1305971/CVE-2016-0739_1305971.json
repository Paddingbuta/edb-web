        "Andreas Schneider of Red Hat reports:\n\nDue to a byte/bit confusion, the DH secret was too short. This file was\ncompletely reworked and will be commited in a future version.\n\nThis issue may be worked around by using other key exchange methods, such as\ncurve25519-sha256 or ecdh-sha2-nistp256, both are not vulnerable.\nBy default, an unpatched libssh implementation will already attempt to use\nthese two more secure methods when supported by the other party.",
