        "A race condition was found in Linux kernel present since v3.14-rc1 upto v4.12 including. The race happens between threads of inotify_handle_event() and vfs_rename() while running the rename operation against the same file. As a result of the race the the next slab data or the slab's free list pointer can be corrupted with attacker-controlled data, which may lead to the privilege escalation.\n\nThe researchers of this flaw are Leilei Lin from Alibaba Group and Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao from a research group supervised by Dr. Heming Cui of the Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong. Thanks to Rui Gu and Prof.Junfeng Yang from Columbia University for tools and suggestions.\n\nReferences:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q3/240https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/3112931https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9755753/https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9755757/https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1408967.htmlhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196279(restricted access)\n\nUpstream patch: 49d31c2f389ahttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=49d31c2f389acfe83417083e1208422b4091cd9",
