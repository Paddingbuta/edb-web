        "Integer overflow when computing memory allocation sizes (similar toCVE-2012-4412) was reported [1] in glibc strxfrm() function. Attached strxfrm-int32.c should trigger this issue on a 32-bit systems.\nAdditionally, it was discovered [1] that strxfrm() falls back to an unbounded alloca if malloc fails making it vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflows (similar toCVE-2012-4424). Attached strxfrm-alloca.c should trigger this issue.\n\nUpstream commit that fixes all issues:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/540[1]:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/540",
